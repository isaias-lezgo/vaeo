# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## The client: Grupo VAEO

This repo is a **single-client fork** of a shared multi-client GHL panel
(`upstream` → `dashboards-GHL`), built to serve **one customer: Grupo VAEO**. Custom
panels are being built for their **two business lines**, which is what the two dashboard
tabs are — not "Marketing" and "Ventas" as in the shared panel.

**VAEO Business Club** (`vaeo.mx`) — flexible-workspace operator in Mexico, founded/led by
Jorge Pizzuto Aznar, ~22 employees, HQ Querétaro. Its pitch is *"Workspitality"* —
hospitality applied to workspace — and *"Tu espacio de trabajo, como te gusta"*. Four
product lines:

| Line | What it is |
|---|---|
| Oficinas virtuales | Fiscal address, package reception, personalized phone answering, IP telephony (3CX), concierge |
| Coworking | Shared flexible desks, community/networking events |
| Oficinas equipadas | Private furnished offices — *"más que oficinas, lugares llenos de experiencias"* |
| Salas de juntas | Meeting rooms, in-person and remote |

Locations: **Monterrey (×2), Querétaro, San Luis Potosí**. Memberships are customizable,
and meeting-room hours transfer between branches — so a lead's *location* matters as much
as their product interest.

**MESH** (`meshcoworking.com`) — the group's **coworking brand**, launched in Monterrey ~5
minutes from San Pedro Garza García, near Hospital San José. Offers private offices,
coworking floor, and meeting rooms. Positioned at entrepreneurs and companies wanting
*"flexibilidad, comodidad y un ambiente inspirador para crecer"*.

**Audience for both panels**: entrepreneurs/freelancers, PYMEs, and corporate clients.
Sales are **membership/lease subscriptions**, not one-off purchases — so retention,
occupancy and lead-to-tour-to-contract flow matter more than the single-purchase funnel
the shared panel was designed around. Keep that in mind when proposing charts.

**Multi-tenancy is no longer a design concern here.** The roster code (`lib/clients.ts`,
password-as-identity, per-location limiter keying) still exists and still works — leave it
alone unless asked — but do **not** weigh new work against cross-client generality, and
don't preserve per-account portability when it complicates a chart. Hardcoding VAEO's
actual pipeline names, stages and custom fields is fine and preferred here.

## Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev        # Start Next.js dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm build      # Production build (TypeScript errors are ignored — see next.config.mjs)
pnpm start      # Serve production build
pnpm lint       # Run ESLint

# Multi-client
pnpm add-client # Add a client to the DASHBOARD_CLIENTS roster (prompts, validates, prints the blob)
                #   Non-interactive: pnpm add-client --name "X" --location <id> --token pit-…

# Verification (see below — there is no test framework)
pnpm verify:clients      # lib/clients.ts   — roster parsing + password lookup
pnpm verify:auth         # lib/auth.ts      — session token; incl. the cookie-tamper rejection
pnpm verify:limiter      # lib/ghl-limiter.ts — per-location isolation
pnpm verify:attachments  # lib/attachments.ts + lib/attachment-tools.ts — tabular parse/query/join
npx tsc --noEmit         # REQUIRED: next build ignores TS errors, so a green build proves nothing
```

**No test framework, and not adopting one.** Instead, the pure modules where a silent
bug would be a *cross-tenant data leak* (clients / auth / limiter) or a silently wrong
answer (attachments) have assertion scripts under `scripts/verify-*.ts` (plain
`node:assert/strict`, run via `tsx`). Run them after touching auth, the roster, the
limiter, or the attachment parsers. Everything else is verified by driving the real app.

There is no way to run a single assertion within a script — each `verify:*` script is
the unit. Run the one that covers the module you touched.

Gotcha when writing these scripts: this package is CommonJS (no `"type": "module"`),
so `tsx` compiles to CJS where **top-level `await` fails**. Wrap async work in a
`main()` and call `main().catch(...)` — see the existing scripts.

**Package manager: pnpm.** This repo is managed with pnpm (`packageManager: pnpm@11.x`
in `package.json`), and the Vercel deploy runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` against
`pnpm-lock.yaml`. **Install and add dependencies with `pnpm install` / `pnpm add <pkg>`
— never `npm install`.** Running `npm install` writes `package-lock.json` but leaves
`pnpm-lock.yaml` stale, which makes the Vercel build fail with
`ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`. If a lockfile ever drifts, run `pnpm install
--lockfile-only` to resync only the lockfile (no `node_modules` churn), then commit it.
A tracked `package-lock.json` lingers from before the switch; it is **not** the source
of truth — ignore it.

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` exists only for its `allowBuilds` list (`sharp`, `esbuild`). pnpm 11
blocks postinstall scripts by default; without those entries the install dies with
`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`. If a new dependency needs a postinstall, add it there.

## Environment Variables

Required vars in `.env.local`:
- `DASHBOARD_CLIENTS` — JSON array of clients, one per GHL sub-account:
  `[{"id","name","locationId","ghlToken","password"?}]`. `password` is optional and
  defaults to that client's `locationId`. Use `pnpm add-client` to extend it safely.
- `DASHBOARD_AUTH_SECRET` — random string used to HMAC-sign the session cookie (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — used by `app/api/chat` (assistant), `analyze-report` (PDF analyses)
  and `analyze-contact`
- `GHL_API_TOKEN` / `GHL_LOCATION_ID` — **not read by the app.** Kept only so the dev
  GHL MCP server (`.mcp.json`) can point at one sub-account.

All are server-side only. `DASHBOARD_CLIENTS` is read in `lib/clients.ts`;
`DASHBOARD_AUTH_SECRET` in `lib/auth.ts`, `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, and
`middleware.ts` — never exposed to the browser.

## Repo docs

- `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-design.md` — the design doc for a feature;
  `docs/superpowers/plans/` — its implementation plan. Both are written **before** the
  code. When picking up non-trivial work on an existing feature, check for its spec first —
  it usually records why an approach was rejected.
- **`README.md` is stale — do not trust it.** It still describes Next 15, SWR caching, a
  `lib/mock-data.ts` fallback, a `filter-bar.tsx` with member/pipeline/tag filters, and a
  `conversations-dashboard.tsx` tab. None of those exist. This file (CLAUDE.md) is the
  accurate description; treat the README as marketing copy.
- `DESIGN.md` — the design system (named color tokens, typography, component rules).
  `PRODUCT.md` — who the three audiences are and what each asks of the same data.
  `snap.md` / `snap2.md` are one-off Playwright accessibility-tree dumps, not docs.

## Architecture

This is a single-page Next.js 16 (App Router) dashboard that surfaces GoHighLevel CRM data in three tabs: **VAEO**, **MESH**, and **Asistente IA**. The multi-tenant machinery from the shared panel is still in place (a client's password resolves to their own GHL sub-account — see "Multi-client" below), but this deployment serves Grupo VAEO only.

### Current state

- `components/dashboard/vaeo-dashboard.tsx` and `components/dashboard/mesh-dashboard.tsx` — **deliberately empty**. The old Marketing/Ventas charts were deleted wholesale so the two business-line panels can be rebuilt from scratch; each currently renders only `PanelPlaceholder`. **Their prop surface is intentionally identical and fully wired** — `app/page.tsx` already feeds both the date-filtered slices and the unfiltered `all*` lookup sets, so a new chart drops in with no plumbing. Keep the two prop lists in sync so a chart can move between panels unchanged.
- Deleted with them (recoverable from git history / `upstream`): `campaign-activity-chart.tsx`, `decision-cycle-table.tsx`, `origen-de-lead-criteria.tsx`. Still present and reusable: `chart-drill-drawer.tsx` (also used by the AI assistant), `detail-drawer.tsx`, `appointment-drill-drawer.tsx`, `export-report-button.tsx`, and all of `dashboard-ui.tsx`.
- The third tab (`DashboardTab` id `"conversations"`, labelled **"Asistente IA"**) renders `conversations-chat.tsx`. It is **permanently mounted and merely hidden** when inactive, so the chat history survives tab switches — do not make it conditional. It always sees the full, unfiltered dataset.
- Both dashboards can **export a branded PDF report** of their own charts (see "PDF report export").

### Data flow

```
browser → middleware.ts (verifies the signed dash_session cookie)
    ↓
app/api/dashboard/route.ts
    ↓  requireClient()  → resolves the cookie's client id to a ClientConfig (lib/session.ts)
    ↓  withClient(...)  → establishes the per-request credential context (lib/ghl-context.ts)
    ↓
lib/ghl-client.ts  (raw GHL types + fetch helpers; reads token+location from the context)
    ↓  lib/ghl-limiter.ts  (concurrency + rate limiting, keyed PER LOCATION)
GHL REST API (services.leadconnectorhq.com)
    ↓  back up: transforms GHL → internal types; contacts/opps/pautas/appointments/tasks fetched concurrently
    ↓  NDJSON stream of {progress|location|step|data|error} frames
hooks/fetch-stream.ts  (parses the NDJSON stream)
    ↓
hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts  (custom streaming fetcher; exposes data, progress text, and structured per-dataset `steps`. No SWR/caching — refresh() re-runs the full sync)
    ↓
app/page.tsx  (tab state, date-filter state, applies the client-side date-range filter, renders dashboard)
    ↓
components/dashboard/{marketing,sales}-dashboard.tsx
```

Beyond that main sync, the app has these routes. Every one that touches GHL runs through
`requireClient()` + `withClient()`; the ones marked **no GHL** work off data the browser
already holds and need only the middleware gate:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dashboard` | the main NDJSON sync above |
| `dashboard-messages` | NDJSON stream of conversation messages, loaded separately from the main sync |
| `conversations` | on-demand full message threads for a batch of contacts |
| `contact-notes` / `contact-tasks` | per-contact detail, fetched live when a drawer opens |
| `analyze-contact` | Anthropic call summarizing one contact (does read GHL for the opportunity) |
| `chat` | one Anthropic turn for the AI assistant — **no GHL** |
| `analyze-report` | Anthropic pass writing the PDF report's analyses — **no GHL** |
| `attachments/process` | parses an uploaded PDF/CSV/Excel for the assistant — **no GHL** |
| `auth/login` / `auth/logout` | session cookie |

Client-side data hooks mirror this: `use-dashboard-data.ts` (main sync),
`use-conversations-data.ts` (messages), `use-agent-loop.ts` (the AI agent loop), all
built on `fetch-stream.ts` for the NDJSON routes.

### Multi-client (multi-tenancy)

One deployment serves every client. **The password IS the client's identity.**

1. `lib/clients.ts` — the roster, parsed from `DASHBOARD_CLIENTS`. This is the
   **seam**: nothing downstream knows the roster comes from an env var, so swapping
   in a database later touches only this file.
2. Login (`app/api/auth/login/route.ts`) looks the submitted password up across the
   roster (`findClientByPassword` — constant-time, no early return) and HMAC-signs
   the matched client's id into the `dash_session` cookie:
   `<clientId>.<expiryMs>.<hmac>`. The id is inside the signed payload, so a client
   cannot edit their cookie to reach another client's data.
3. Every GHL-touching route calls `requireClient()` (`lib/session.ts`), which
   re-verifies the cookie **itself** — it deliberately does not trust a
   middleware-injected header, which would be a spoofing surface. Middleware only
   verifies the signature; resolving the client there would drag the roster into the
   Edge bundle.
4. The route runs its GHL work inside `withClient(client, ...)`
   (`lib/ghl-context.ts`, an `AsyncLocalStorage`). `ghlFetch` reads credentials via
   `currentClient()`, which is why none of its ~113 exported functions needed a
   signature change. `currentClient()` **fails closed** — it throws rather than
   falling back to a default token.
5. `lib/ghl-limiter.ts` keys the concurrency semaphore, token bucket, and 429
   cooldown **by location id**, because GHL's budget is per location. Shared, one
   client's 429 would freeze every other client's sync.

**NEVER** replace the AsyncLocalStorage context with a module-level "current client"
variable: one serverless instance serves overlapping requests, so that would
silently serve client A's dashboard using client B's token.

**Password model — a deliberate, informed tradeoff. Do not "fix" it unprompted.**
A client's password defaults to their GHL `locationId`. That id is *not* a secret
(it appears in GHL URLs, embed codes, webhook payloads, Make scenarios) and it
**cannot be rotated**. The owner accepted this knowingly, for the convenience of
having nothing extra to manage. The escape hatch is already built in: the optional
`password` field on a client entry overrides the default, so any single client can be
given a real, rotatable password by adding one line — no migration, no code change.
Suggest that if a password leaks; don't rewrite the model on your own initiative.

The two streaming routes (`dashboard`, `dashboard-messages`) enter the context
**inside** the `ReadableStream` `start()` callback — the stream outlives the
handler's return, so wrapping the handler would leave the pump running outside the
context.

`app/api/chat` and `app/api/analyze-report` never touch GHL (they work off data the
browser already holds), so they need no client context — only the middleware gate.

Verification scripts (no test framework in this repo): `pnpm verify:clients`,
`pnpm verify:auth`, `pnpm verify:limiter`.

### Loading & progress

The dashboard fetch streams NDJSON progress frames rather than returning a single JSON blob, so the UI can show live progress during the multi-second GHL sync:
- `{ type: "location", name }` — sub-account name (resolved first, for the loading header).
- `{ type: "step", key, status, count }` — structured per-dataset progress. `key` ∈ `config | contacts | opportunities | pautas | appointments | tasks`; `status` ∈ `loading | done`. Because those datasets are fetched **concurrently**, the loading screen (`components/dashboard/loading-screen.tsx`) renders one live row per dataset with a running count, plus a determinate progress bar driven by completed-step count.
- `{ type: "progress", message }` — human-readable fallback text.
- `{ type: "data", ... }` / `{ type: "error", ... }` — terminal frames.

### AI assistant

The assistant is an **agent loop that runs in the browser**, not on the server.

- `app/api/chat/route.ts` handles exactly **one Anthropic turn per request**. When the
  model returns `tool_use` blocks the server just returns them; `hooks/use-agent-loop.ts`
  executes the tools locally and POSTs back with `tool_result` blocks. The server holds
  **no session state** between turns.
- `lib/ai-tools.ts` — the ~25 `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` and their executor. Most tools
  (`search_*`, `aggregate`, `relate`, `get_*`) run **against the dataset the browser
  already holds** — no extra GHL calls. The exceptions reach back through
  `lib/ghl-fetchers.ts` for data not in the initial sync: `get_contact_messages`,
  `search_conversations`, `get_contact_tasks`, `get_contact_notes`.
- UI-side tools: `render_chart` → `chat-chart.tsx`, `ask_user` → `chat-question.tsx`,
  `show_in_panel` → the conversations context panel, `create_pdf` / `export_csv` →
  direct browser downloads.
- `lib/conversations-panel.ts` holds the context panel's logic (extracted from the
  component so it stays testable-by-inspection): the **urgency buckets** are derived from
  the last message only — inbound and unanswered for >72 h = `red`, 24–72 h = `yellow`,
  under 24 h = `grey`; anything the team already replied to is `grey`. Contacts sort by
  bucket, then oldest-activity-first inside a bucket.
- `lib/ai-context.ts` — the Spanish system prompt. It carries hard-won behavioral rules
  (date-window consistency, never concluding from a truncated message sample, `lostReason`
  being a native field, never printing IDs). **Treat those numbered rules as regression
  fixes, not prose** — each one exists because the model got it wrong. Don't trim them
  for brevity.
- `lib/ai-index.ts` — `buildChatIndex()` precomputes the by-contact lookup maps
  (`oppsByContact`, `pautasByContact`, `pautaNameByContact`, …), cached on the contacts
  array reference so it survives within a single agent run.
- `datasetSummary` is built once on the client and pinned for **prompt caching**; keep
  it stable across turns in a session or the cache key breaks.
- **Timezone**: the browser's IANA zone is posted as `userTimezone` on every `chat` and
  `analyze-contact` call; both routes fall back to `America/Mexico_City`. Dates rendered
  into a prompt must go through that zone — the server runs in UTC on Vercel, so
  formatting a timestamp without it shifts "yesterday" by a day for the client.

#### File attachments

Users can drop PDF / CSV / Excel files into the assistant composer.

- `app/api/attachments/process/route.ts` parses uploads server-side (`unpdf` for PDF,
  `xlsx` for tabular) into `ProcessedAttachment` objects. It touches no GHL. Limits:
  32 MB PDF, 25 MB tabular; each Excel sheet becomes its own table.
- **PDF text-vs-visual fallback**: if extracted text is under `MIN_PDF_TEXT` (40
  non-whitespace chars) the PDF is assumed scanned and re-sent as a native base64
  document block for Claude to read visually, instead of as text.
- **Tabular files are never pasted into the prompt.** Only a summary (schema, row count,
  8 sample rows, per-column stats from `buildTableSummary`) goes to the model; the full
  rows stay in the browser in `uploadedTablesRef` (`hooks/use-agent-loop.ts`) and are
  queried through the `list_uploaded_files` / `query_uploaded_table` /
  `join_uploaded_table` tools, executed locally by `lib/attachment-tools.ts`. Keep it that
  way — a spreadsheet inlined into the prompt blows the context and the cache.
- `lib/attachments.ts` stays framework-free (shared by the route and the verify script);
  the client-only file reading lives in the composer.

### Shared domain rules (single sources of truth)

Four small `lib/` modules exist so Marketing, Ventas, and the AI tools all agree on the
same definitions. **Never re-inline any of this logic in a component** — a local copy
that drifts makes two tabs report different numbers for the same question, which is the
bug class these modules were extracted to kill.

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `lib/pauta.ts` | what counts as "de pauta" + campaign-name resolution (below) |
| `lib/opportunity-status.ts` | `isWonOpp()` — canonical "won" detection |
| `lib/source-platform.ts` | "Origen de lead" platform bucketing + `PLATFORM_COLORS` / `PLATFORM_ORDER` |
| `lib/csv.ts` | CSV cell escaping (`csvCell`, `buildCsv`) |

- **`isWonOpp()`**: some sub-accounts never flip `status` to `"won"` — they record a sale
  by moving the opportunity into a late stage ("09. Negocio Ganado") while `status`
  stays `"open"`. Detection matches the **stage name** (`/ganad[oa]|\bwon\b/i`), never
  hardcoded stage IDs, so it stays portable across locations. An explicitly
  `lost`/`abandoned` opp is never a win regardless of stage.
- **`source-platform.ts`**: buckets into Instagram / Facebook / TikTok / Google / Otro by
  loose substring match, because field *names* differ per sub-account ("Origen de Lead"
  vs "Origen del Lead", "Tipo de pauta" vs "Tipo de anuncio"). **WhatsApp is deliberately
  absent** — it's a contact channel, not a lead origin, so a bare "whatsapp" stays in
  "Otro". `components/dashboard/origen-de-lead-criteria.tsx` is the UI that explains these
  rules to the user; keep the two in sync.
- **`csv.ts`**: shared by the assistant's `export_csv` tool and the drill drawer's
  "Exportar" button (`lib/drill-export.ts`), so both files escape identically.
  `lib/download.ts` triggers the actual browser download for both.

#### Pauta (paid-advertising) classification

`lib/pauta.ts` is the **single source of truth** for what counts as "de pauta", shared by
the marketing charts and the AI tools. Do not re-inline this logic anywhere.

- `isDePauta(opp, pautaContacts)` — a deliberate **union**: the contact is linked to a
  Pauta custom-object record **OR** the opportunity itself carries a paid-traffic
  source/medium (`isPaidTraffic`). Neither signal alone is complete — Pauta records come
  from a Make scenario and don't always exist, and not every paid lead keeps its UTM — so
  each covers the other's gaps.
- `resolveCampaignName()` — an ordered fallback chain, since sub-accounts name the field
  differently ("Nombre pauta", "Nombre de la pauta", …) and some accounts have no
  attribution URL at all.
- Totals legitimately differ between grouping modes; that's by design, not a bug.

### PDF report export

Both dashboards export a branded PDF via `components/dashboard/export-report-button.tsx`.

- `lib/report.ts` composes a `ReportInput` (KPIs + `ReportSection[]`) from the dashboard's
  **already-computed aggregates** — deterministic code, not the model.
- `app/api/analyze-report/route.ts` then makes one Haiku pass that writes an executive
  summary plus one analysis per section. Sections are analyzed **by default**; `ai: false`
  opts out. Token budget is sized to the section count (~13 marketing / ~8 ventas) — if you
  add sections, check it still fits.
- `lib/pdf/*` renders the spec with pdfmake: `build-pdf.ts` (doc definition — **LETTER
  landscape**, 712pt usable width), `charts.ts` (hand-drawn canvas charts), `blocks.ts`
  (tables/KPIs), `branding.ts` (palette, `sanitizeBrand`).
- The same `create_pdf` spec/renderer backs the AI assistant's PDF tool, so both outputs
  share one format. Changing `lib/pdf/*` affects both.
- **Brand rule**: `sanitizeBrand()` strips "GoHighLevel"/"GHL" from all rendered text —
  the platform is presented as "Lezgo Suite CRM". The AI prompts carry the same rule.
- pdfmake **cannot render in a bare Node harness** — verify PDF changes by building and
  driving the real app.

### Key design decisions

- **No mock-data fallback**: when the GHL API is unavailable or errors, the UI renders against empty arrays (`data?.contacts ?? []` patterns in `app/page.tsx`). The former `lib/mock-data.ts` and its stand-ins have been removed.
- **All GHL API calls are server-only**: `lib/ghl-client.ts` is never imported from client components — only from API routes. This keeps the token out of the browser bundle. Client code reaches GHL data through `lib/ghl-fetchers.ts`, which calls those routes.
- **`/opportunities/search` uses `location_id` (snake_case)** while most other endpoints use `locationId` (camelCase). The `useSnakeCaseLocationId` flag in `ghlFetch` handles this quirk.
- **Filtering is entirely client-side and date-range only**: `lib/date-range.ts` (`DateFilter`, `resolveDateRange`, `filterByDateRange`) filters the already-fetched dataset by date; `components/dashboard/date-range-filter.tsx` is the UI. The filtered slices are computed in `app/page.tsx` and passed to each dashboard as props. The date filter bar is hidden on the AI assistant tab, which always sees the full dataset.
- **`calls` is always empty** in live data — GHL doesn't expose a public calls endpoint in the standard API. **`tasks` is populated** via the location-wide `/locations/:id/tasks/search` endpoint (`searchLocationTasks`), fetched concurrently with the other datasets.
- **Drill-downs resolve joins against the *unfiltered* set.** Dashboards take both
  `opportunities` (date-filtered, for display) and `allOpportunities` (everything, as a
  lookup table) — likewise `allContacts` / `allPautas` / `allAppointments`. An opportunity
  can be created outside the window that puts its contact on screen, so joining against the
  filtered slice silently drops real rows. Keep that pairing when adding a drawer.

### Internal type system

`lib/types.ts` defines the canonical internal types (`Contact`, `Opportunity`, `Pauta`, `Appointment`, `Call`, `Task`, `Message`, `Pipeline`). The API route transforms raw GHL shapes into these before returning JSON. Always work against the internal types in components — never import from `lib/ghl-client.ts` on the client side.

## GHL API Gotchas

> Full schema reference: `/Users/isaiasrios/Downloads/GHL-API-Schemas.md`

- **Version header required** on all requests: `Version: 2021-07-28` (legacy) or `2023-02-21` (current).
- **customFields shape differs between read and write**:
  - Write (create/update): `{ id, key, field_value }`
  - Read (contacts): `{ id, value }`
  - Read (opportunities): `{ id, fieldValue }`
- **Tags on contacts**: sending `tags` in update/upsert **overwrites all existing tags**. Use `/contacts/:id/tags` (POST/DELETE) for incremental changes.
- **Opportunity status** valid values: `open`, `won`, `lost`, `abandoned`, `all` (`all` is search-filter only).
- **`lostReasonId`** is only relevant when status is `"lost"`.
- **`/opportunities/search`** uses snake_case params (`location_id`, `pipeline_id`, etc.) — already handled by `useSnakeCaseLocationId` flag in `ghlFetch`.
- **Conversation `type`** is numeric in some endpoints: `1=Phone`, `2=Email`, `3=FB Messenger`, `4=Review`, `5=Group SMS`.
- **Required scopes**: `contacts.readonly/write`, `opportunities.readonly/write`, `conversations.readonly/write`.

## GHL MCP Server

An HTTP MCP server (`ghl-mcp`, configured in `.mcp.json`) connects directly to GoHighLevel's hosted MCP endpoint (`https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/`). It authenticates with the same `GHL_API_TOKEN` and `GHL_LOCATION_ID` env vars used by `lib/ghl-client.ts`.

- **Purpose**: lets Claude Code query/mutate live GHL data directly during development (inspecting real contacts, opportunities, pipelines, custom fields, conversations) without writing throwaway scripts. It is **not** part of the app's runtime data flow — the app always goes through `app/api/dashboard/route.ts` → `lib/ghl-client.ts`. Never wire MCP calls into application code.
- **Use it to**: verify real data shapes, discover pipeline/custom-field IDs, confirm API behavior, and validate transforms against production data before coding them in `route.ts`.
- **Tools** (prefixed `mcp__ghl-mcp__`), grouped:
  - `contacts_*` — get-contact, get-contacts, create/update/upsert-contact, add-tags, remove-tags, get-all-tasks
  - `opportunities_*` — get-opportunity, search-opportunity, get-pipelines, update-opportunity
  - `conversations_*` — search-conversation, get-messages, send-a-new-message
  - `locations_*` — get-location, get-custom-fields
  - `calendars_*` — get-calendar-events, get-appointment-notes
  - `payments_*` — list-transactions, get-order-by-id
  - `blogs_*`, `emails_*`, `social-media-posting_*` — content/marketing operations
- **Caution**: write tools (create/update/upsert/send/post) mutate live production data. Default to read-only tools; only use write tools when explicitly asked.

### UI components

- `components/ui/` — shadcn/ui components (generated, do not hand-edit)
- `components/dashboard/` — domain components; each dashboard component receives already-filtered data as props
- `components/dashboard/date-range-filter.tsx` is the only global filter UI; the `DateFilter` type lives in `lib/date-range.ts`
- Charts use Recharts via the shadcn chart wrapper (`components/ui/chart.tsx`)
- `components.json` controls shadcn/ui config (alias `@/components/ui`, Tailwind CSS v3)
- Shared chart chrome lives in `dashboard-ui.tsx`: `ChartCardHeader`, `ScopePill` (scope
  label + tooltip explaining a chart's rule), and `CardTone` (won/lost card tints — the
  light/dark pairs are tuned by eye, not numerically matched; don't "normalize" them)

**Chart conventions** — apply to every new chart:
- Use `NonZeroTooltipContent` so empty series don't render noise, and wire a drill-down
  drawer (`chart-drill-drawer.tsx`) — every chart should be clickable through to its records
- No visual encoding that requires a legend to decode
- Never nest a scroll container inside a card. For narrow scrollable panels use a plain
  `overflow-y-auto` div — Radix `ScrollArea` breaks `truncate`
